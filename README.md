# 42 Push Swap


## Introduction

The **push_swap**  project is a simple and a highlyl straightforward algorithm project: Data needs to be sorted!<br><br>

You have at your disposal a set of integers values, 2 stacks, and a set of instructions to manipulate both stacks.<br><br>

The goal of this project is to write a `C` program called `push_swap` which calculated and displays on the standard output the smallest program, made of ***Push Swap language*** instructuions, that sorts the integers received as arguments.
